A nodejs directory walker. Broadcasts events for various file types as well as
a generic "entry" event for all types and provides the ability to prune

```javascript
Walker('/etc/')
  .filterDir(function(dir, stat) {
    if (dir === '/etc/pam.d') {
      console.warn('Skipping /etc/pam.d and children')
      retur
